### Installation and Setup
* Install the [Anaconda distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Python 2.7x.
* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* Once you receive an email invitation from [Slack](https://slack.com/), join our "SF\_DAT\_15 team" and add your photo!

### Resources
* [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)

### Class 1: Introduction / Expectations / Git Intro
* Introduction to General Assembly
* Course overview: our philosophy and expectations ([slides](slides/01_course_overview.pdf))
* Git overview: ([slides](slides/01_git_github.pdf))
* Tools: check for proper setup of Git, Anaconda, overview of Slack

**Homework:**

* Resolve any installation issues before next class.
* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called "SF_DAT_15"
* Clone the class repo (this one!)
* Review this [code](code/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.

**Optional:**

* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists.
* Look over Data science overview ([slides](slides/01_course_overview.pdf))
* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

### Class 2: Python
* Brief overview of Python environments: Python interpreter, IPython interpreter, Spyder, Rodeo
* Python quiz ([code](code/02_python_quiz.py))
* Check out some iPython Notebooks!
* Working with data in Python in Spyder
    * Todays data comes from Nate Silver's blog, [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/alcohol-consumption)
    * and also from the [Open Weather Data Project](http://openweathermap.org/) They have a great API!!
    * Reading, writing, and graphon oh my! in Python ([code](code/02_files_and_weather.py))

**Homework:**

* Finish the [Python exercise](code/02_files_and_weather_lab.py) 
* Read through the [project page](project.md) in detail.
* Review a few [projects from past Data Science courses](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT-project-examples) to get a sense of the variety and scope of student projects.

**Optional:**

* If you need more practice with Python, review the "Python Overview" section of [A Crash Course in Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182), work through some of [Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python), or work through [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) and its exercises.
* For more project inspiration, browse the [student projects](http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2013.html) from Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) at Stanford.

**Resources:**

* [Online Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) is useful for visualizing (and debugging) your code.
