## Class 20 Exercise: Predicting Survival on the Titanic

This assignment uses data from Kaggle's [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) competition. `titanic.csv` is in the repo, so there is no need to download the data from the Kaggle website.

Wait WHAT?? We did this in class 8, what gives Sinan?


**Tasks:**

1. Read `titanic.csv` into a DataFrame.

2. Fit a machine learning model with the highest accuracy of survival possible.




That's it.. I'm serious that's it. We are at a point where you no longer need to be coddled with 10 step labs. I have a very basic problem. I need to predict survival on the titanic with this data. Use a decision tree, logistic regression, SVM, kmeans, whatever you need to.


Note that we are also at a point where you might have biases over which models you "like better". Logistic regression if your favorite, Naive bayes makes the most sense, etc.. Play around with everything! Challenge yourself or the person next to you and try to win!
