##### Part 1 #####


# 1. read in the yelp dataset

# 2. Perform a linear regression using 
# "stars" as your response and 
# "cool", "useful", and "funny" as predictors

# 3. Show your MAE, R_Squared and RMSE

# 4. Use statsmodels to show your pvalues
# for each of the three predictors
# Using a .05 confidence level, 
# Should we eliminate any of the three?

# 5. Create a new column called "good_rating"
# this could column should be True iff stars is 4 or 5
# and False iff stars is below 4

# 6. Perform a Logistic Regression using 
# "good_rating" as your response and the same
# three predictors


# 7. Show your Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity
# and Confusion Matrix


# 8. Perform one NEW operation of your 
# choosing to try to boost your metrics!




##### Part 2 ######

# 1. Read in the titanic data set.

# 4. Create a new column called "wife" that is True
# if the name of the person contains Mrs.
# AND their SibSp is at least 1

# 5. What is the average age of a male and
# the average age of a female on board?

# 5. Fill in missing MALE age values with the
# average age of the remaining MALE ages

# 6. Fill in missing FEMALE age values with the
# average age of the remaining FEMALE ages


# 7. Perform a Logistic Regression using
# Survived as your response and age, wife
# as predictors

# 8. Show Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity and 
# Confusion matrix


# 9. now use ANY of your variables as predictors
# Still using survived as a response to boost metrics!


# 10. Show Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity
